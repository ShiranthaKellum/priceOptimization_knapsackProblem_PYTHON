# priceOptimization_knapsackProblem_PYTHON
This program optimizes a buyer's price using the solution to the knapsack problem.

Piyasena is the owner of the “Lakmal” rice mill. He collects paddy from different areas of the country and
converts them into polished rice. Every sack he brings for the collection process can hold a maximum of
7 KG of paddy. One day he went on collecting paddy and there were farmers with various types of paddy
containers who were willing to sell their paddy to Piyasena. A paddy container is a large repository
which has the capacity of multiple 7 KG sacks. Each container has various quantities. For example, there
are some containers with 1 sack of 7 KG and some have multiple 7 KG sacks in them. Farmers are willing
to sell either the whole container or the individual sack of 7KG from the container. But never agrees to
sell a portion of the sack.
Each paddy container has a tag indicating the number of 7 KG sacks in each container and the price of
the whole container.
You have to implement a program to help Piyasena to buy the maximum quantity of paddy by paying the
least amount of money. Given the number of sacks he bought and the information on the paddy
containers, you have to find the minimum value piyasena should be paying to purchase the maximum
quantity of paddy.
Please note that he cannot fill any of the sacks with more than one type of paddy.
